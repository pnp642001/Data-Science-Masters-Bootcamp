        "Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a random variable. It is a statistical parameter that measures the deviation of a given dataset from a normal distribution. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same, and the skewness is zero. However, when the distribution is not symmetrical, the skewness will be non-zero, indicating the direction and degree of asymmetry. A positive skewness means that the tail of the distribution is longer on the right-hand side, and a negative skewness means that the tail is longer on the left-hand side. Skewness is an important measure in statistics as it helps to identify any deviation of data from the normal distribution and helps to understand the shape of the distribution of the data."
