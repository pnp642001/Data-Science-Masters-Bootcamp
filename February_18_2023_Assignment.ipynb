Google Maps provides an API that allows developers to integrate its mapping and location data into their own applications. This enables applications to display maps, directions, and location-based information to users within the context of the application. For example, ride-sharing applications like Uber and Lyft use Google Maps API to provide location-based services to their users. Users can see the driver's location on the map, get real-time traffic updates, and receive accurate directions to their destination."
