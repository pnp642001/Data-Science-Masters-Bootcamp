This leads to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data. The consequences of overfitting are that the model performs well on the training data, but poorly on the test data.\n",

Early stopping stops the training process when the performance on the validation set starts to decrease, which helps prevent the model from overfitting. Data augmentation techniques increase the size of the training set by generating new examples from the existing ones, which helps the model learn more robust features.\n",
