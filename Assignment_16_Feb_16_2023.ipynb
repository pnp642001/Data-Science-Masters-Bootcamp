        "* Databases are used in a variety of applications, including websites, business applications, scientific research, and more.\n",
        "* SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of databases.\n",

        "* SQL databases are known for their ability to handle complex queries, support for transactions, and strong consistency guarantees. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
        "* NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of ways, including key-value pairs, documents, and graphs. They do not use a structured query language like SQL, but instead use APIs to interact with the data. \n",
        "* NoSQL databases are known for their ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data, scale horizontally, and provide high availability. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."
