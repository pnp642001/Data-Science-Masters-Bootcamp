        "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating population parameters based on sample data. In this approach, a sample is drawn from a population of interest, and sample statistics such as mean, variance, or proportion are used to estimate the corresponding population parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Point estimate refers to a single value that is used to estimate the population parameter. For instance, the sample mean is commonly used as a point estimate of the population mean. Point estimates, however, may not always be accurate, and they do not provide any information about how precise the estimate is.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interval estimate, on the other hand, is a range of values that is used to estimate the population parameter. It takes into account the sampling variability and provides an indication of how precise the estimate is. The interval estimate is typically constructed around the point estimate and is based on the confidence level and the standard error of the point estimate. The confidence level refers to the probability that the interval estimate will contain the true population parameter, and it is typically set at 90%, 95%, or 99%."
