        "statistics is a science of collecting, organizing and analyzing the data. In other way, we can say that statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It involves the use of various techniques to extract meaning from data, make predictions and draw conclusions about populations or samples. It is widely used in different fields such as business, medicine, economics, social sciences, and many more to help understand trends, make decisions, and solve problems."

However, if we treat this as ordinal data, we can calculate the median rating, but cannot calculate the mean or standard deviation. If we treat this as interval data, we can calculate the mean rating and the standard deviation, and perform more advanced statistical analysis. Thus, understanding the level of measurement is crucial for selecting appropriate statistical techniques to analyze data."
